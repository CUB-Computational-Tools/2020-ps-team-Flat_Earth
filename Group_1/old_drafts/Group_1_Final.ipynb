    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{dh}{dl} = \\textrm{hydraulic gradient} \n",

    "So **advection is just the movement of the ground water through the soil**. Now were going to talk about how the **contaminant moves through the water**.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mechanical Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical dispersion is a phenomenon of groundwater moving through a porous medium, with the water travelling at different velocities at different points. The different velocities of water cause mixing. This is due to 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) fluids traveling faster through larger pores than through smaller pores\n",
