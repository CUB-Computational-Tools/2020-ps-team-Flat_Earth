    "# How Solutes are Transported in Groundwater\n",
    "\n",
    "So we've got groundwater, a soil that the groundwater is in, and a source of contamination. That contamination is going to spread throughout the water and soil through a process of **Hydrodynamic Dispersion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advection\n",
    "\n",
    "Something we need to mention very briefly is **Advection**, which is just the physical transport of a substance or quantity by bulk motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "v_x = -\\frac{K}{n_e} * \\frac{dh}{dl}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "v_x = \\textrm{average linear ground-water velocity} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "K = \\textrm{hydraulic conductivity} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "n_e = \\textrm{effective porosity} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{dh}{dl} = \\textrm{hydraulic gradient} \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "So **advection is just the movement of the ground water through the soil**. Now were going to talk about how the **contaminant moves through the water**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're talking about hydrodynamic dispersion, we gotta keep 2 things in mind: **Molecular Diffusion**, and **Mechanical Dispersion**. We will essentially **combine these two processes to give us hydrodyanmic dispersion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Molecular Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a container that starts with a concentration of a solute in one area, over time, that solute becomes evenly distributed in the container due to random molecular motion. The molecules go from higher concentration to lower concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](MolecularDiffusion.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So that same kinda phenomenon is happening in the water/soil itself. The contaminant (solute) is going to be spreading itself among the solvent (water) to be more equally distributed in the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mechanical Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical dispersion is a phenomenon of groundwater moving through a porous medium, with the water travelling at different velocities at different points. The different velocities of water cause mixing. This is due to 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) fluids traveling faster through larger pores than through smaller pores\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) fluids traveling shorter pathways and/or splitting or branching to the sides\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) fluids moving faster through the center of the pores than along the edges \n",

    "\n",
    "# Hydrodynamic Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
